# Security Policy

## Security Features

This application implements multiple layers of security to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Session Management**: JWT-based sessions with configurable expiration (30 days default)
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware ensures only authenticated users can access protected resources
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data through ownership validation

### Input Validation
- **Schema Validation**: All user inputs validated with Zod schemas
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type correctness throughout the application
- **Server-Side Validation**: Never trust client-side validation alone
- **Sanitization**: Automatic XSS prevention through React's built-in escaping

### Database Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM uses parameterized queries
- **Connection Security**: Secure database connections with SSL in production
- **Cascade Deletes**: Proper referential integrity with cascade delete rules
- **No Sensitive Data in Logs**: Passwords and tokens never logged

### HTTP Security Headers
The application sets the following security headers:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

### CSRF Protection
- Built-in CSRF protection through Next.js
- Same-site cookie policies
- Token validation for state-changing operations

### Environment Variables
- Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- `.env.example` provided without secrets
- `.env` excluded from version control

### Error Handling
- Structured error responses without sensitive information
- Stack traces only in development mode
- Comprehensive logging for security events

### Rate Limiting Recommendations
For production deployments, implement:
- Request rate limiting at the API gateway or load balancer level
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Account lockout after repeated failures

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Do Not** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to resolve the issue.

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Configuration

1. **Generate Strong Secrets**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
   Use this for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in production.

2. **Use Environment-Specific URLs**
   ```env
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com  # Production URL
   ```

3. **Database Security**
   - Use PostgreSQL in production (not SQLite)
   - Enable SSL for database connections
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Restrict database access by IP

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Change all default secrets and passwords
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS for all connections
- [ ] Configure production database with SSL
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Enable security headers (configured in `next.config.ts`)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure backup procedures
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches

### Regular Maintenance

- Update dependencies regularly: `npm update`
- Review security advisories: `npm audit`
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Review and rotate secrets periodically
- Keep Node.js and system packages updated

## Password Policy

The application enforces the following password requirements:

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number

For production use, consider:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Special character requirement
- Password strength meter
- Prevention of common passwords
- Password history to prevent reuse

## Compliance Considerations

Depending on your use case, consider compliance with:

- **GDPR**: User data privacy and right to deletion
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act requirements
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability standards
- **HIPAA**: If handling healthcare data
- **PCI DSS**: If processing payment information

## Security Monitoring

Implement monitoring for:

- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Database query anomalies
- Application errors and exceptions
- Performance degradation (potential DoS)

## Data Protection

### Data at Rest
- Database encryption (PostgreSQL supports TLS)
- Encrypted backups
- Secure file storage

### Data in Transit
- HTTPS/TLS for all connections
- Secure WebSocket connections (if added)
- Certificate validation

### Data Retention
- Define and implement data retention policies
- Secure data deletion procedures
- Regular cleanup of old data

## Third-Party Dependencies

This application uses the following security-focused dependencies:

- **NextAuth.js**: Industry-standard authentication
- **bcryptjs**: Secure password hashing
- **Prisma**: SQL injection prevention
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation

All dependencies are regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
